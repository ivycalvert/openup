            'Open up' is a small scale project dedicated to presenting user Google Takeout data. This site is situated within the second and third HCI paradigms, as the primary focus is on the interpritation of the data and how the user reacts to the design. 
            <!--A social experiment intended to make internet users more aware of what they post online, this site requires you to download and interact with your Google Takeout data. This site will not keep or store any of the data you upload, that data is yours...and Googles. Click the below button to continue to the site-->

            This site requires the user to download their personal Google Takeout data and interact with it. To do this, users are required first to download this data from the link provided on the Home page (the infomration currently required for this site is: Location History, Search History, and Profile information). Once this information is downloaded, the user can advance into the site where they will then be prompted in turn as to what files need uploading and where.

            Personal security is very important to the 'Open up' project, and as a result 'Open up' uses local storage. This means that any data is only accessible to the site while that page is in session. As soon as the tab is refreshed, changed, or exited by the user, all data is deleted with it. With this system, the data remains in the control and posession of the user. 'Open up' does not store or track any user information.

To interact with this page, you are required to upload both your location history and your search history. Your location history json file needs to be uploaded to the section labeled "Locations", and one of your search history json files needs to be uploaded to the section labeled "Searches". To find your lacation history, within your Takeout folder, there will be a folder labeled "Location History". Upload the json file stored within this folder. To find your search history, within your Takeout folder, there will be a folder labeled "searches".
